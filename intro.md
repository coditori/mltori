#### Data Definition:
Everything our senses perceive is data, though its storage in our cranial wet stuff leaves something to be desired. Writing it down is a bit more reliable, especially when we write it down on a computer. When those notes are well-organized, we call them data... though Iâ€™ve seen some awfully messy electronic scribbles get the same name.<sup>[1]</sup>

#### Pattern Definition:

  A pattern is the repeated or regular way in which something happens or is done.<sup>[2]</sup><br/>
Example: All three attacks followed the same pattern.

#### What is Algorithm
An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem. It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.
An algorithm is also used to manipulate data in various ways, such as inserting a new data item, searching for a particular item or sorting an item.<sup>[4]</sup>

#### Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition 
  Machine Learning is a field that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. A Machine Learning algorithm then takes these examples and produces a program that does the job. 

  Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using a Machine Learning algorithm. Pattern recognition can be defined as the classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted from patterns and/or their representation.<sup>[5]</sup>

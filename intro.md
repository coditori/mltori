Example: All three attacks followed the same pattern.

#### What is Algorithm
An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem. It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.
An algorithm is also used to manipulate data in various ways, such as inserting a new data item, searching for a particular item or sorting an item.<sup>[3]</sup>

#### Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition 
  Machine Learning is a field that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. A Machine Learning algorithm then takes these examples and produces a program that does the job. 

  Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using a Machine Learning algorithm. Pattern recognition can be defined as the classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted from patterns and/or their representation.<sup>[4]</sup>

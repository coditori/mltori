#### Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition 
Machine Learning is a field that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. A Machine Learning algorithm then takes these examples and produces a program that does the job. 

Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using a Machine Learning algorithm. Pattern recognition can be defined as the classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted from patterns and/or their representation.<sup>[3]</sup>
